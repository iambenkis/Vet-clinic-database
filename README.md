# Vet clinic Database

> In this project, I use transactions to update and delete records. I also use aggregate functions and GROUP BY to answer analytical questions.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- `schema.sql`: contains the database schema in SQL.
- `data.sql`: contains some data to insert into the database.
- `queries.sql`: contains some queries that can be run against the database.
